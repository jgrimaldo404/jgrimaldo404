## What am I doing?
I am a recent graduate who is trying his best as a Junior Developer. I've collaborated with other developers to create simple, intuitive, & fun websites (Can be found in my repos). As for my day to day now, I mainly deal with C# but have experience in some way with the languages and tools below.

## Why open source?
I believe open source allows many great minds to take on and collaborate on ambitious projects. Being able to help out on projects, whether they are small or big, will always have a positive impact on those involved in it. I believe the best idea should always win and open source makes that possible. 

## What am I listening to?
